	Successive governments treated the judiciary unfairly and the administration never wanted the judiciary to run independently, Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha said yesterday.
The judiciary provided protection to the administration too and the bureaucracy always considered <SUP>judiciary </SUP>as its contender, he added.
The CJ was speaking at a reception for him hosted by Habiganj District Bar Association at the Bar <SUB>library</SUB>.
Sinha said administrative officials seek justice from the judiciary after being denied protection at their respective departments. The judiciary then plays a role in upholding their rights.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is likely to inaugurate the 80-kilometre marine drive road from Cox's Bazar to Teknaf as the third phase of the project is at the final stage, said sources of the local administration. 

The work of the giant project aimed at developing fast communication in the famous tourist zone started in 1999.

The infrastructure at a cost of Tk 456 crore was implemented in three phases -- 24 km between Kalatoli to Inani was built in the first phase, and then 24 km from Shilkhali to Teknaf upazila headquarters and lastly 32 km road from Shilkhali to Sabrang in Teknaf, said Rana Priyo Barua, executive engineer of Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in Cox's Bazar.

The marine drive has already contributed to an attractive tourist-friendly ambiance along with economic growth in Ukhia and Teknaf where hotels, cottages and resorts are being constructed.

"The marine drive adds to the modernity and recreational facilities in Cox's Bazar. It brings bright prospect of massive economic growth in the area," said Lt Col Forkan Ahmed (retd), chairman of Cox's Bazar Development Authority. 

"This road is a milestone in Cox's Bazar. Every day, hundreds of tourists are travelling on the road amid eye catching natural beauty," said M Kibria Khan, president of Tour Operators Association in Cox's Bazar.

Abdur Rahman Bodi, lawmaker from Cox's Bazar-4 (Ukhia-Teknaf), emphasised branding of the marine drive road.

Bangladesh Army's 16 Engineer Construction Battalion is conducting the construction work of the marine drive under a project of the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges.

When it comes to addressing the waterlogging problem in Dhaka city, Wasa is a "failed organisation", said Dhaka South City Corporation Mayor Sayeed Khokon yesterday.

"Wasa is not working properly to solve the waterlogging problem. Rather, they are busy with projects involving hundreds of crores of taka," he said while speaking at the inaugural ceremony of "Dhaka Uthshab-2017"at TSC of Dhaka University. Dhaka Debating Society organised the programme.

The mayor said it is necessary to merge Wasa (Water Supply and Sewerage Authority) with the two city corporations in Dhaka or change its leadership to solve the crisis.

Though it is the duty of Wasa to address the problem, Khokon said, they are not paying attention to it. 

"This cannot go on. We want a proper management in Wasa as there is no alternative," the mayor said.

"There are many problems in the city. I don't have the mandate to solve all the problems. But people expect me to solve those as their representative," the mayor added.

Incessant downpour in the last few days caused huge waterlogging at different parts of the city, which revealed the weakness in managing the drainage system in Dhaka city. Many areas including Karwan Bazar, Gandaria, Kathalkbagan, West Shewrapara, Dhanmondi, Nayapaltan, Fakirapool, Razabazar, Shantinagar and different parts of Old Town were the worst affected areas. 

Since the canals, the primary drainage system of the city, are blocked, they cannot hold the huge volume of storm water released during the monsoon, said locals in different areas.

This messy situation could be attributed to encroachment on the drainage canals and low-lying areas by various vested quarters, inadequate drainage and pumping facilities, a lack of coordination in management of facilities by various agencies, change of drainage pattern due to land development or other human interventions, and in some areas, insufficient cleaning of drainage system, they added

Many areas including Karwan Bazar, Gandaria, Kathalkbagan, West Shewrapara, Dhanmondi, Nayapaltan, Fakirapool, Razabazar, Shantinagar and different parts of Old Town were the worst affected areas. 

Since the canals, the primary drainage system of the city, are blocked, they cannot hold the huge volume of storm water released during the monsoon, said locals in different areas.

This messy situation could be attributed to encroachment on the drainage canals and low-lying areas by various vested quarters, inadequate drainage and pumping facilities, a lack of coordination in management of facilities by various agencies, change of drainage pattern due to land development or other human interventions, and in some areas, insufficient cleaning of drainage system, they added

When it comes to addressing the waterlogging problem in Dhaka city, Wasa is a "failed organisation", said Dhaka South City Corporation Mayor Sayeed Khokon yesterday.

"Wasa is not working properly to solve the waterlogging problem. Rather, they are busy with projects involving hundreds of crores of taka," he said while speaking at the inaugural ceremony of "Dhaka Uthshab-2017"at TSC of Dhaka University. Dhaka Debating Society organised the programme.

The mayor said it is necessary to merge Wasa (Water Supply and Sewerage Authority) with the two city corporations in Dhaka or change its leadership to solve the crisis.

Though it is the duty of Wasa to address the problem, Khokon said, they are not paying attention to it. 

"This cannot go on. We want a proper management in Wasa as there is no alternative," the mayor said.

"There are many problems in the city. I don't have the mandate to solve all the problems. But people expect me to solve those as their representative," the mayor added.

Incessant downpour in the last few days caused huge waterlogging at different parts of the city, which revealed the weakness in managing the drainage system in Dhaka city.
